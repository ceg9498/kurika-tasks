<div class="content">
  <!--
    This should function like a "dashboard" 
    Display a selection of timers that need attention (ones marked important)
    Display some actions, such as 'add timer' widget thingy

    (not yet ready to create this component - need to create the others first!)

  <p>home works!</p>
